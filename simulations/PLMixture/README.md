# Poisson–Lognormal (PL) Mixture Simulations

This folder contains simulation and figure-generation code for a
**two-component Poisson–Lognormal (PL) mixture model** used in the robustness
experiments of the accompanying paper.

---

## Model specification

The true data-generating model is a two-component PL mixture with:

- Mixing proportion: π₁ = 0.3
- Component 1: Lognormal(μ₁ = 3, σ₁ = 0.5)
- Component 2: Lognormal(μ₂ = 1, σ₂ = 0.5)
- Number of mixture components: K = 2 (known)

## Simulation and figure script

### `simulation_figure_PL_mixture.m`

This script replicates the figure titled:

> *“Outlier robustness for a Poisson–Lognormal (PL) mixture (known K = 2)”*

The experiment evaluates the robustness of parameter estimation under
increasing levels of contamination for the PL mixture model specified above.

The script generates the results used directly in the figure; no data splitting
or model selection is performed in this setting, as the mixture order K is
assumed to be known.

## Computational notes

Simulation settings are configurable within the script. For quick verification,
reduced Monte Carlo settings may be used, while full-scale settings corresponding
to the paper results are documented in the code comments.

No simulation outputs or figures are stored in the repository; all results are
generated by running the script locally.
