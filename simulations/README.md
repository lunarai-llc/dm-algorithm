# Simulation Studies

This folder contains all simulation code used in the numerical experiments of
the accompanying paper.

The simulations are organized by statistical model. Each subfolder corresponds
to a specific mixture model and contains the scripts required to reproduce the
tables and figures reported in the paper.

---

## Folder structure

- `NormalMixture/`  
  Simulations for finite **normal mixture models**.

- `PoissonMixture/`  
  Simulations for **Poisson mixture models** using discrete kernel estimators.

- `PGMixture/`  
  Simulations for **Poisson–Gamma (PG) mixture models**, including kernel
  comparisons, robustness experiments, and model selection with DIC.

- `PLMixture/`  
  Simulations for **Poisson–Lognormal (PL) mixture models**, focusing on
  robustness under contamination.

Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` describing the model specification,
simulation setup, and correspondence between scripts and tables or figures in
the paper.

## Example usage

This folder also includes an example HTML file demonstrating how to use the
combined function:

- `Mixture_Model_No_Regress.m`

The example illustrates how the unified mixture modeling functions can be
applied in practice.

## Computational notes

Some simulations are computationally intensive and may require substantial
runtime for full-scale reproduction. Scripts are typically configured with
reduced settings for quick verification, while full simulation settings used in
the paper are documented in the individual scripts.

Simulation outputs are not stored in the repository and are generated by running
the scripts locally.
