# Poisson–Gamma (PG) Mixture Simulations

This folder contains simulation and figure-generation code for **two-component
Poisson–Gamma (PG) mixture models** used in the numerical experiments of the
accompanying paper.

The true data-generating model throughout is a two-component PG mixture:
\[
0.3\,PG(10,1) + 0.7\,PG(1,2).
\]

---

## Model specification

- Mixing proportion: π₁ = 0.3
- Component 1: PG(α₁ = 10, β₁ = 1)
- Component 2: PG(α₂ = 1, β₂ = 2)
- Sample size: n varies depending on the experiment

## Simulation scripts

### `simulation_PG_mixture.m`

This script replicates the table titled:

> *“Estimates Using Different Kernels for  
> 0.3 PG(10,1) + 0.7 PG(1,2)”*

Results are obtained by **varying the sample size n**, which must be updated
manually in the script to reproduce the corresponding rows of the table.

---

### `simulation_two_PG_ISE.m`

This script computes the **Integrated Squared Error (ISE)** for the PG mixture
model as the sample size n varies.

The output from this script is used to generate the figure titled:

> *“Mean of ISE for Model  
> 0.3 PG(10,1) + 0.7 PG(1,2) as n changes”*

---

### `simulation_PG_mixture_K_unknown_data_splitting.m`

This script replicates the table in which the **number of mixture components K is
unknown** and is identified using the **Divergence Information Criterion (DIC)**
combined with **data splitting**.

## Figure-generation scripts

### `Figure_Mean_ISE_PG_Mixture.m`

Generates the figure titled:

> *“Mean of ISE for Model  
> 0.3 PG(10,1) + 0.7 PG(1,2) as n changes”*

using the outputs produced by `simulation_two_PG_ISE.m`.

---

### `Simulation_figure_PG_outlier.m`

Replicates the figure titled:

> *“Average parameter estimates versus contamination level ε  
> in a two–component PG mixture with known K = 2.”*

This experiment studies robustness under contamination.

## Computational notes

Some simulations in this folder are computationally intensive, especially for
larger sample sizes. Scripts are configurable and may be run at reduced settings
for quick verification. Full-scale settings used in the paper are documented
within the individual scripts.

No simulation outputs are stored in the repository; results are generated by
running the scripts locally.
